        # NB: simple numeric shard names are used here instead of the more common practice of e.g. 1/N, 2/N, ... to resolve a GitHub Actions error if unsupported characters across filesystems are found and used in artifact file paths (e.g. NTFS doesn't support `/`). GitHub implemented this validation check to enable better cross-platform support. Since the matrix shard ID is used in artifact uploads below, using `/` would throw an error.
